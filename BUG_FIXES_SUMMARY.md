# Bug Fixes Summary - Updated

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Settings UI Jumping Issue ✅

**Problem**: When typing in the admin settings text inputs, the page would jump and close the admin settings expander unexpectedly.

**Root Cause**: Text inputs were causing Streamlit to rerun the app continuously as users typed, leading to UI jumping and loss of focus.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped all display text configuration inputs in a Streamlit form (`st.form`)
- Changed from individual `st.button` to `st.form_submit_button` for saving
- This prevents auto-reruns while typing and only triggers rerun when the form is submitted

**Files Modified**: 
- `app.py` (lines ~450-520): Modified admin display text configuration section

### 2. Room Allocation Logic Issue 🔍 (DEBUGGING ENHANCED)

**Problem**: Teams with Tuesday/Thursday preferences were sometimes allocated to Monday/Wednesday slots even when Tuesday/Thursday rooms were available (e.g., Project Breeze shown in the image).

**Root Causes Investigated**:
1. **Incorrect fallback logic**: Fixed - Teams now prioritize their original preference first in fallback
2. **Insufficient logging**: Fixed - Added comprehensive debugging
3. **Possible room availability issue**: Teams might not be getting preferred slots due to capacity constraints

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Fixed preference ordering in fallback**:
   - Teams that prefer Tuesday/Thursday now try Tuesday/Thursday first in fallback, then Monday/Wednesday
   - Teams that prefer Monday/Wednesday now try Monday/Wednesday first in fallback, then Tuesday/Thursday
   
2. **Enhanced debugging and logging**:
   - **Team categorization**: Shows exactly how each team's preferences are parsed and which group they're assigned to
   - **Room availability tracking**: Shows which rooms are already used on each day during placement attempts
   - **Detailed placement attempts**: Shows every team placement attempt with available rooms and capacity matching
   - **Preference honor tracking**: Shows whether each team got their preferred days or had to use fallback
   - **Unplaced team tracking**: Shows which teams couldn't be placed after each phase
   
3. **New debugging output includes**:
   ```
   Processing team Project Breeze: raw='Tuesday,Thursday' -> parsed=['Tuesday', 'Thursday']
   → Added to Tuesday/Thursday group
   
   Attempting placement for Tuesday/Thursday - 5 teams
   Teams to place: ['Project Breeze', 'Team A', ...]
   Rooms already used on Tuesday: ['Room 00205', 'Room 00289']
   Rooms already used on Thursday: ['Room 00205', 'Room 00289']
   
   Trying to place Project Breeze (size 5) in Tuesday/Thursday
   Available rooms: ['Room 00208', 'Room 00210'] (capacity >= 5)
   ```

**Files Modified**: 
- `allocate_rooms.py`: Added extensive debugging throughout the allocation process

## Next Steps for Diagnosis

With the enhanced debugging, the next allocation run will provide detailed information about:

1. **Why Project Breeze didn't get Tuesday/Thursday**: 
   - Were there available rooms with sufficient capacity?
   - Were Tuesday/Thursday slots already full?
   - Did Project Breeze get processed in the correct preference group?

2. **Room utilization patterns**:
   - Which rooms are being used on which days
   - Whether there's a capacity or availability issue

3. **Preference parsing accuracy**:
   - Verify that "Tuesday,Thursday" is correctly parsed as `['Tuesday', 'Thursday']`

## Technical Details

### Debugging Features Added
```python
# Team preference parsing debugging
print(f"Processing team {team_name}: raw='{preferred_days_str}' -> parsed={pref_day_labels}")

# Room availability debugging  
print(f"Available rooms: {[r['name'] for r in possible_rooms_for_team]} (capacity >= {team_size})")

# Preference honor tracking
preference_honored = (fb_day1_label, fb_day2_label) == (original_pref_labels[0], original_pref_labels[1])
honor_status = "✓ PREFERENCE HONORED" if preference_honored else f"⚠ Fallback used (wanted {original_pref_labels})"
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the allocation with debugging**: The console output will now show exactly why teams are placed where they are
2. **Check room capacity vs team size**: Verify that teams requiring larger rooms aren't being blocked by capacity constraints  
3. **Monitor preference parsing**: Confirm that stored preferences match what's being parsed
4. **Review timing**: Check if teams are submitting preferences after rooms are already allocated

## Expected Outcome

The enhanced debugging will reveal the exact reason why Project Breeze (and other teams) are not getting their preferred Tuesday/Thursday slots, allowing for targeted fixes to the allocation algorithm.
