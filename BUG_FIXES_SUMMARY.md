# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Settings UI Jumping Issue

**Problem**: When typing in the admin settings text inputs, the page would jump and close the admin settings expander unexpectedly.

**Root Cause**: Text inputs were causing Streamlit to rerun the app continuously as users typed, leading to UI jumping and loss of focus.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped all display text configuration inputs in a Streamlit form (`st.form`)
- Changed from individual `st.button` to `st.form_submit_button` for saving
- This prevents auto-reruns while typing and only triggers rerun when the form is submitted

**Files Modified**: 
- `app.py` (lines ~450-520): Modified admin display text configuration section

### 2. Room Allocation Logic Issue

**Problem**: Teams with Tuesday/Thursday preferences were sometimes allocated to Monday/Wednesday slots even when Tuesday/Thursday rooms were available.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Incorrect fallback logic**: In the fallback allocation, teams that preferred Tuesday/Thursday were trying Monday/Wednesday first instead of retrying their preferred days
2. **Insufficient logging**: No visibility into why preferences weren't being honored

**Solutions**:
1. **Fixed preference ordering in fallback**:
   - Teams that prefer Tuesday/Thursday now try Tuesday/Thursday first in fallback, then Monday/Wednesday
   - Teams that prefer Monday/Wednesday now try Monday/Wednesday first in fallback, then Tuesday/Thursday
   
2. **Enhanced logging**:
   - Added detailed logging for each placement attempt
   - Shows available rooms for each day pair
   - Indicates whether preference was honored or fallback was used
   - Added summary of placement results before fallback phase

**Files Modified**: 
- `allocate_rooms.py` (lines ~185-250): Modified fallback allocation logic and added enhanced logging

## Technical Details

### Admin Settings Form Implementation
```python
# OLD (caused jumping):
new_text = st.text_input("Label", value, key="unique_key")
if st.button("Save"):
    save_to_database(new_text)

# NEW (prevents jumping):
with st.form("admin_form"):
    new_text = st.text_input("Label", value)
    if st.form_submit_button("Save"):
        save_to_database(new_text)
```

### Room Allocation Logic Fix
```python
# OLD (incorrect preference order):
if original_pref_labels == ["Tuesday", "Thursday"]:
    fallback_day_pairs = [("Monday", "Wednesday"), ("Tuesday", "Thursday")]  # Wrong order!

# NEW (correct preference order):
if original_pref_labels == ["Tuesday", "Thursday"]:
    fallback_day_pairs = [("Tuesday", "Thursday"), ("Monday", "Wednesday")]  # Correct order!
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Settings**: Test typing in the display text fields to confirm no jumping occurs
2. **Room Allocation**: 
   - Create test scenarios with teams preferring Tuesday/Thursday
   - Run allocation and check logs to verify preferences are honored when possible
   - Monitor console output for detailed placement information

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Admin can now edit settings without UI jumping
2. **Fairer Allocation**: Teams more likely to get their preferred days when rooms are available
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify allocation issues
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns and improved code structure
